## Set Theory
A **set** is a collection of objects. In probability theory, set notation is used to specify [compound events](https://www.math.net/compound-events).

As an example, rolling an even number for a dice roll can be represented by the following set: `{2, 4, 6}` where the contents of the set are even numbered dice rolls.

### Simple and Compound Events
- **Simple Event:** Event that can have only *one* outcome.
- **Compound Event:** Event that includes *two* or more simple events.

## Counting
Counting can be very difficult when it comes to counting the number of sequences or sets satisfying certain conditions.

### Permutations
The number of possible arrangements in a set when the **order** of arrangements matters.

### Combinations
All or a part of an a set of objects where order **does not** matter.

## Conditional Probability
Conditional probability is the probability of an event A occurring, given that another event B is known to have occurred.

For example: What is that probability it will rain given that the sky is overcast?
