# Probability Distributions
A probability distribution specifies the relative likelihoods of all possible outcomes.

**NOTE:** I'll be coming back to this section in a few weeks, but will be taking a step back to better develop my knowledge of probability with other sources. I have found seeing theory, while flashy and superficially simple, to be lacking in detail.

## Random Variables - Formal Definition
A random variable is a function that assigns a real-number value to each outcome in a [probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space).

## Discrete and Continuous
There are two primary classes of probability distributions:
- discrete
- continuous

### Discrete
A discrete random variable has a **finite** (countable) number of possible values.

### Continuous
A continuous random variable takes on an **infinite** (uncountable) number of possible values (all real numbers).
