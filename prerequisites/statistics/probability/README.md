*Probability Theory* is a mathematical framework for analyzing chance events in a logically sound manner. The probability of an event is a number indicating how likely an event is to occur.<sup>[1](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)</sup>.

The probability of an event is a number ranging from 0 to 1:
* 0 = Impossible
* 1 = Certain

### [Random Variable](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section1)
A mathematical object where a real-number value is assigned to each possible outcome.

For example, take a coin toss: 
* heads = 1
* tails = 0

## Expectation
The expectation of a random variable is a number that attempts to capture the center of that random variable's distribution.

A more precise definition: **The probability weighted sum of all possible values in random variable's support**.

### Expectation Formula
> E[X]=∑x∈xP(x)

`E[X]` represents the expected value for random variable **X**.

Lowercase `x` represents all possible values within the random variable.

`P(x)` is the probability for each value x.

`Σ` denotes a sum of all terms.
