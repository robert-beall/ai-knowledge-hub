# Statistics
In this section, I will be building out my knowledge of statistics. It's kind of odd that I took a decent amount of math in high school and plenty of compsci courses in college, but never managed to take a statistics course. As such, it's a bit of an undiscovered country for me.

I will be updating this README as I move along, but for now, I will list the following resources as a starting point:

* [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html)
* [Josh Starmer Statistics Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer)
* [Useful Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/mu2ty2/q_best_resources_to_learn_basic_statistics/)
