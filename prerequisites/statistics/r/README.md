# Learning R
Because I'm trying to learn statistics, it'll probably be useful to learn R so I can pair labs with the written lesson.

For now, I'm going to list some potentially useful sources:

* [Swirl Stats (interactive)](https://swirlstats.com/)
* [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
